     - Sale Items: Special and sale items are visually distinguished with badges, indicating discounted prices.

     - Image Placeholder: Product images are represented by placeholders generated using the dummyimage.com service, providing a visual representation of each product.

     - Star Ratings: Special and popular items display star ratings to indicate their popularity or special status.
  
     - Footer: A footer section provides copyright information for the website, typically located at the bottom of the page.
